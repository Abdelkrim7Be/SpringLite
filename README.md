# SpringLite - Mini Dependency Injection Framework

SpringLite is a lightweight dependency injection framework inspired by Spring Framework. This project aims to implement the core features of dependency injection to understand how frameworks like Spring work under the hood.

## Goals

- Create a simple yet functional dependency injection container
- Support XML-based configuration
- Support annotation-based configuration
- Support different types of dependency injection:
  - Constructor injection
  - Setter injection
  - Field injection
- Handle bean lifecycles (singleton and prototype scopes)
- Provide clear error messages for common issues

## Features

- Bean definition and registration
- Bean retrieval via BeanFactory
- Application context for managing the bean container
- XML configuration parsing
- Annotation-based bean discovery
- Various injection mechanisms

## Usage

More details coming soon as the project progresses.

## Project Structure

The core components are:

- `BeanFactory`: Interface for accessing beans
- `ApplicationContext`: Extended interface for configuration
- `BeanDefinition`: Class to hold bean metadata
